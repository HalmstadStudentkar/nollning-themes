Child Theme based on Hemingway theme

In the master branch you'll find basic files to start from scratch. In
other words, everything needed that will be the same for all sites.

Every child site will have a branch where specific changes are
applied. They will be treated as "master branches" and you should
always branch of a sub master before starting work.
